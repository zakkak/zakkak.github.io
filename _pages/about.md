# Bio

Hi! I am Foivos (pronounced ['fivos]) Zakkak and I am a Software
Engineer in [IBM's][] (previously [Red Hat's][]) Java platform team  working on [Mandrel][], [GraalVM][] and [Quarkus][].
Prior to joining IBM and Red Hat I spent 9.5 years as a post-graduate and post-doctoral researcher.
I worked at
the [Advanced Processor Technologies (APT)][] group of
the [University of Manchester][] where I led the development of the [Maxine VM][], a metacircular Java-in-Java VM.
Before that I worked at
the [Computer Architecture and VLSI Systems Laboratory (CARV)][]
of [FORTH-ICS][], where in the context of the [GreenVM project][], I
developed [DiSquawk][], a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that targets
non-cache-coherent architectures. During my post-graduate studies I also
developed [SCOOP][], a
source-to-source compiler that used information from task annotations
(memory footprints) to generate optimized code for task-based runtime
systems. I was also involved in the development and performance
analysis process of the TPC (Tagged Procedure Calls), BDDT (Block-level
Dynamic Dependence Analysis for Deterministic Task-Based Parallelism)
and [PARTEE][] (PARallel Task Execution Engine) task-based runtime
systems.
